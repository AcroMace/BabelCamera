# BabelCamera

Find out how to describe the things around you in another language!

An iOS app using [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) and the [Vision framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision) in iOS 11 as well as the [Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate).

## Demo

*The app also reads the words aloud*

## Running

1. Get a [Google Translate API Key](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/getting-started)
2. Copy `Keys.example.xcconfig` to `Keys.xcconfig` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in the file with your API key from step 1
3. Clean build folder / clear derived data (`⌥⇧⌘K`)
4. Run the app

## Vision model

The app currently comes with [SqueezeNet](https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet). You can replace it with another model available on the [Apple's Core ML page](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) (ex. `ResNet50`, `Inception v3`, `VGG16`) by dragging the `.mlmodel` file (ex. `VGG16.mlmodel`) into Xcode where you see `SqueezeNet.model`, and then:

In `VisionService.swift`, replace the line:

	model = try? VNCoreMLModel(for: SqueezeNet().model)

with

	model = try? VNCoreMLModel(for: VGG16().model)

or the model of your choice
